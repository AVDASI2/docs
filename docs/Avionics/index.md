# START HERE

!!! abstract

    These docs take you from zero to a minimum viable product that just about meets the Avionics criterial in the requirements spec, allowing students to take things from there in any direction that they wish.

!!! note

    Much of what we do references external open-source resources that you should follow - these aren't duplicated here as they're updated frequently elsewhere. If you encounter any inconsistencies in our docs please [raise an issue](https://github.com/AVDASI2/docs/issues) or even better [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) with a correction.
