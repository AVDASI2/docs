# Avionics

!!! abstract

    These docs take you from zero to a minimum viable product that just about meets the Avionics criterial in the requirements spec, allowing students to take things from there in any direction that they wish.

## Getting started

If you're just starting out, follow the [step-by-step guide](stepbystep) to get to a minimal working example system.

[Step-by-step Avionics Guide :material-step-forward-2:](stepbystep/index.md){: .md-button .md-button--primary }

!!! note

    Much of what we do references documentation for external open-source resources - these aren't duplicated here as they're updated frequently elsewhere. If you encounter any inconsistencies in our docs please [raise an issue](https://github.com/AVDASI2/docs/issues) or even better [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) with a correction. Any external issues, try searching for error messages etc., then discuss with the unit team. If you find a bug or an error (and you're confident it's not you, it's them) feel free to give back to the community by contributing changes to open-source projects too!
