# Step-by-step guide

This guide will take you through to a 'minimum working example' (MWE) that meets the relevant criteria in the requirements specification. You should use this for learning and familiarisation, and build upon this to implement your own solution.

There are many routes to meeting the requirements, those presented here are those that the Flight Lab and AVDASI2 teaching team have determined best for learning, but feel free to experiment with any alternatives that you find.

!!! info "Link labels"

    Some of the steps require you to follow instructions on external sites, but there are also links included for wider reference. These are labelled with icons:

    * :material-step-forward: Follow this link as part of the current step, then come back to this page to continue.
    * :material-information: This link is for reference, you don't need to follow it right now.


!!! note

    Much of what we do references documentation for external open-source resources - these aren't duplicated here as they're updated frequently elsewhere. If you encounter any inconsistencies in our docs please [raise an issue](https://github.com/AVDASI2/docs/issues) or even better [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) with a correction. Any external issues, try searching for error messages etc., then discuss with the unit team. If you find a bug or an error (and you're confident it's not you, it's them) feel free to give back to the community by contributing changes to open-source projects too!
