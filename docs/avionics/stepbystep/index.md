# Step-by-step guide

This guide will take you through to a 'minimum working example' (MWE) that meets the relevant criteria in the requirements specification. You should use this for learning and familiarisation, and build upon this to implement your own solution.

There are many routes to meeting the requirements, those presented here are those that the Flight Lab and AVDASI2 teaching team have determined best for learning, but feel free to experiment with any alternatives that you find.
