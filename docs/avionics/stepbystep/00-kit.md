# Avionics kit

Avionics teams will be issued with kits that will enable them to create a minimum-working-example system. The core components of this are part of the [University of Bristol Flight Lab](http://flightlab.bristol.ac.uk)'s standard research hardware and software stack, and have been flown around the world including over volcanoes, for conservation and humanitarian projects, and for search and rescue missions.

Kits will be signed out and should be returned at the end of the unit in reusable order. Each kit contains a **Bill of Materials** that details kit contents.

More info on signout, return, etc. in lectures and on SharePoint.
