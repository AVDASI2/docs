# AVDASI 2 docs

This site contains general documentation for the AVDASI 2[^1] design, build, and test unit. It's aimed at students on the unit, but we're publishing it openly in case it's useful to others. If you use it, [we'd love to hear about it](mailto:AVDASI2@bristol.ac.uk).

As of the current teaching year, this site is largely for the [Avionics](avionics/index.md) and [Mechanisms](mechanisms/index.md) subdisciplines. See the unit Sharepoint for other resources.

## Site info

This site is part of the [AVDASI 2 GitHub org](https://github.com/AVDASI2), which contains a number of useful repositories. These docs pages are formatted using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/).

!!! note

    Much of what we do references documentation for external open-source resources - these aren't duplicated here as they're updated frequently elsewhere. If you encounter any inconsistencies in our docs please [raise an issue](https://github.com/AVDASI2/docs/issues) or even better [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) with a correction. Any external issues, try searching for error messages etc., then discuss with the unit team. If you find a bug or an error (and you're confident it's not you, it's them) feel free to give back to the community by contributing changes to open-source projects too!
