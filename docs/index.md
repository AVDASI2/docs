# AVDASI 2 docs

This site contains general documentation for the AVDASI 2[^1] design, build, and test unit. It's aimed at students on the unit, but we're publishing it openly in case it's useful to others. If you use it, [we'd love to hear about it](mailto:AVDASI2@bristol.ac.uk).

It's hosted on the [AVDASI 2 GitHub org](https://github.com/AVDASI2), and uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) auto-compiled via a GitHub Action. Code from repos like [AVDASI 2 Example_Code](https://github.com/AVDASI2/Example_Code) can be auto-synced to the docs so code snippets can be displayed and will update after every new push. 

## Contribute

Anyone can [fork and pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) changes to the docs which will be reviewed by admins and published.
